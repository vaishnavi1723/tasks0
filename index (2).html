<p>What Does Java Mean?
<br><br>
Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.
<br>
Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist with Sun Microsystems, together with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton.

<p>What is C Programming Langauge?
<br><br>
C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.

<H3 style="color: red; font-size: 30px;backround color:purple"> PYTHON </H3>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
<br><br>
Python is Interpreted - Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
<br><br>
Python is Interactive - You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
<br><br>
Python is Object-Oriented - Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
<br><br>
Python is a Beginner's Language - Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

<H4 style="color:yellow; font-size:30px;"> C++ </H4>
<p>C++
<br><br>
C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.
<br><br>
A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.
